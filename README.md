## Installation Instructions

* NOTE: This app isn't going to work because I didn't include the Firebase files.
* After downloading the files, run ```npm install``` and then ```npm start``` and then ```react-native-run-ios```

Made almost zero progress today. Tried to connect app to Firebase using react-native-firebase and the [manual integration](https://rnfirebase.io/docs/v5.x.x/installation/initial-setup) for [iOS](https://rnfirebase.io/docs/v5.x.x/installation/ios) but when I tried to follow the instructions and then run the project, the app would crash immediately on the simulator with no error message.
<br><br>
Finally, decided to use delete all the changes I made and revert to previous commit. Instead of importing ```react-native-firebase``` I just imported ```firebase``` and referred to one of my previous projects to try to authenticate.
<br><br>
Got a little stuck here for a bit due to a syntax error, (forgot to add ```{}``` when importing a constant from another js file}) and went down a rabbithole because of the the simulator error message stating that I had an "invalid API key".
However, with commit 4, we have successfully connected Firebase and authenticated anonymously.
